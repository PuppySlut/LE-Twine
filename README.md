## A note from the transcriber:

Hi, I'm nxtm4n, or EroticEnby - a fan of [puppyslut](https://github.com/PuppySlut)'s work who dislikes the language she's using for [the Lesbian Education project](https://github.com/PuppySlut/LE) (largely for its lack of ability to save the game). Therefore, I'm transcribing the game into Twine.

I'm going to do my best to be as faithful to the original game as possible, in terms of content, and just add in a few quality-of-life features like saving, a scene gallery, and maybe some improved grammer. I will not be either adding or removing any additional content.

If and when puppyslut updates the game, I'll try to get around to updating this game as well - however, it's unlikely to be my priority.

## How-To:

To run this game, simply download the repository by clicking the green **CODE** button and choose the Download ZIP option. Once it's downloaded, unzip it with 7zip or your program of choice. Once it's unzipped, you can run the game by opening index.html in your browser of choice.
